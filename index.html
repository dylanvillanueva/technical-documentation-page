                <h2>An Introduction to JavaScript</h2>
            </header>
            <p>Let's see what's so special about JavaScript, what we can acheive with it, and what other technologies
                play well with it.</p>
            <h3>What is JavaScript?</h3>
            <p><em>JavaScript</em> was initially created to "make web pages alive."</p>
        </section>
        <section id="manuals_and_specifications" class="main-section">

                <h2>Manuals and Specifications</h2>
            </header>
            <p>This book is a <em>tutorial</em>. It aims to help you gradually learn the language. But once you're
                familiar with the basics, you'll need other resources.</p>
            <h3>Specification</h3>
            <p><a href="https://www.ecma-international.org/publications-and-standards/standards/ecma-262/">The ECMA-262
                    specification</a> contains the most in-depth, detailed, and formalized information about Javascript.
                It defines the language.</p>

        <section id="code_editors" class="main-section">
            <header>
                <h2>Code Editors</h2>
            </header>
            <p>A code editor is the place where programmers spend most of their time.</p>
            <p>There are two main types of code editors: IDEs and lightweight editors. Many people use one tool of each
                type.</p>
            <h3>IDE</h3>
            <p>The term <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment">IDE</a> (Integrated
                Development Environment) refers to a powerful editor with many features that usually operates on a
                "whole project." As the name suggests, it's not just an editor, but a full-scale "development
                environment."</p>
            <p>An IDE loads the project (which can be many files), allows navigation between files, provides
                autocompletion based on the whole project (not just the open file), and integrates with a version
                management system (like <a href="https://git-scm.com/">git</a>), a testing environment, and other
                "project-level" stuff.</p>
            <p>If you haven't selected an IDE yet, consider the following options:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a> (cross-platform, free)</li>
                <li><a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/">WebStorm</a> (cross-platform, paid)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>For Windows, there's also "Visual Studio", not to be confused with "Visual Studio Code." "Visual Studio"
                is a paid and mighty Windows-only editor, well-suited for the .NET platform. It's also good at
                JavaScript. There's also a free version <a
                    href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/">Visual Studio Community</a>.</p>
            <p>Many IDEs are paid, but have a trial period. Their cost is usually negligible compared to a qualifed
                developer's salary, so just choose the best one for you.</p>
            <h3>Lightweight editors</h3>
            <p>"Lightweight editors" are not as powerful as IDEs, but they're fast, elegant, and simple.</p>
            <p>They are mainly used to open and edit a file instantly.</p>
            <p>The main difference between a "lightweight editor" and an "IDE" is that an IDE works on a project-level,
                so it loads much more data on start, analyzes the project structure if needed, and so on. A lightweight
                editor is much faster if we need only one file.</p>
            <p>In practice, lightweight editors may have a lot of plugins including directory-level syntax analyzers and
                autocompleters, so there's no strict border between a lightweight editor and an IDE.</p>
            <p>There are many options, for instance:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a> (cross-platform, shareware)</li>
                <li><a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/">Notepad++</a> (Windows, free)</li>
                <li><a href="https://www.vim.org/">Vim</a> and <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">Emacs</a>
                    are also cool if you know how to use them</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section id="developer_console" class="main-section">
            <header>
                <h2>Developer Console</h2>
            </header>
            <p>Code is prone to errors. You will quite likely make errors... Oh, what am I talking about? Your are
                <em>absolutely</em> going to make errors, at least if you're a human, not a <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bender_(Futurama)">robot</a>.</p>
            <p>But in the browser, users don't see errors by default. So, if something goes wrong in the script, we
                won't see what's broken and can't fix it.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="hello_world" class="main-section">
            <header>
                <h2>Hello World</h2>
            </header>
            <p>This part of the tutorial is about core JavaScript, the language itself.</p>
            <p>But we need a working environment to run our scripts and, since this book is online, the browser is a
                good choice. We'll keep the amount of browser-specific commands (like <code>alert</code>) to a minimum
                so that you don't spend time on them if you plan to concentrate on another environment (like Node.js).
                We'll focus on JavaScript in the browser in the next part of the tutorial.</p>
            <p>So first, let's see how we attach a script to a webpage. For server-side environments (like Node.js), you
                can execute the script with a command like <code>node my.js</code>.</p>
            <h3>The "script" tag</h3>
            <p>JavaScript programs can be inserted almost anywhere into an HTML document using the
                <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag.</p>
            <p>For instance:</p>
            <div class="code">
                <code>
                        &lt;!DOCTYPE HTML&gt;
                        <br>
                        &lt;html&gt;
                        <br><br>
                        &lt;body&gt;
                        <br><br>
                        <span class="tabbed-one">&lt;p&gt;Before the script...&lt;/p&gt;</span>
                        <br><br>
                        <span class="tabbed-one">&lt;script&gt;</span>
                        <br>
                        <span class="tabbed-two">alert( 'Hello, world!' );</span>
                        <br>
                        <span class="tabbed-one">&lt;/script&gt;</span>
                        <br><br>
                        <span class="tabbed-one">&lt;p&gt;...After the script.&lt;/p&gt;</span>
                        <br><br>
                        &lt;/body&gt;
                        <br><br>
                        &lt;/html&gt;
                    </code>
            </div>
            <p>The <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag contains JavaScript code which is automatically executed when the
                browswer processes the tag.</p>
